##Step 1: Alice creates a new project and hosts it on GitHub.
(When Alice is done, her project will look like this. If you're following along as Bob, you can "fork" my example of the rhymes repo here: https://github.com/bryanhirsch/rhymes)

First, Alice opens up a terminal and creates a Git repository from the command line:

'''markdown
# Create a folder for your project.
mkdir rhymes
cd rhymes

# To make this directory and empty Git repo do this:
git init 

# I usually create an empty README.txt file for the first commit in my project
# history. 
touch README.txt 
git add README.txt 
git commit -m 'First commit.' 

# Add some explanation about the project to the README file.
echo 'This repo is a collection of my favorite nursery rhymes.' >> README.txt

# Review uncommitted changes. Then commit them.
git status
git diff
git add README.txt
git commit -m 'Added project overview to README.txt'
'''
